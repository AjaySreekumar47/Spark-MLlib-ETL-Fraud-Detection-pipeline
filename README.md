# Spark-MLlib-ETL-Fraud-Detection-pipeline
This project builds a scalable fraud detection system using PySpark for ETL and feature engineering, with model training and evaluation conducted in both Colab (XGBoost + SHAP) and Databricks (Spark MLlib). It demonstrates end-to-end handling of large transactional data, class imbalance resolution, metric evaluation, and interpretable ML.
